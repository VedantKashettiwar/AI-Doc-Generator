# Payment Gateway Integration Module

This module handles **secure payment processing** using multiple third-party providers (Stripe, PayPal) and ensures reliable transaction management.

---

## Overview

The `Payment Gateway Integration Module` provides a unified API layer to process payments, handle refunds, and manage webhooks from supported providers. It is designed with **high availability**, **idempotency**, and **PCI-DSS compliance** in mind.

---

## Features

- Supports multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal)
- Unified interface for processing payments and refunds
- Webhook handling with signature verification
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed transactions
- Detailed transaction logging and audit trails
- Idempotency keys to prevent duplicate charges


## API Endpoints

### POST /payments/charge

Initiates a payment transaction.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "provider": "stripe",
  "amount": 4999,
  "currency": "USD",
  "paymentMethodId": "pm_123456789"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "transactionId": "txn_abc123",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

---

### POST /payments/refund

Initiates a refund for a previous payment.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "transactionId": "txn_abc123",
  "amount": 4999
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "refundId": "rfnd_789xyz",
  "status": "processed"
}
```

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints return consistent error structures:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "PAYMENT_FAILED",
    "message": "Insufficient funds or invalid payment method."
  }
}
```

---

## Dependencies

- express
- axios
- stripe
- paypal-rest-sdk
- uuid
- winston (for logging)

---

## Environment Variables

- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID
- PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
- DB_URI
- LOG_LEVEL

---

## Security Considerations

- All payment information is handled via PCI-compliant providers.
- Webhooks are validated using HMAC signatures.
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate transactions.
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3).

---

## Scalability

- The module is stateless and can be deployed in multiple instances behind a load balancer.
- Retries are handled asynchronously via a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS).
- Transaction data is stored in a write-optimized database for high throughput.

---

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Cover all business logic and error cases using Jest.
- **Integration Tests:** Run with sandbox credentials for Stripe and PayPal.
- **Load Tests:** Simulate 1000 concurrent payment requests per second to validate performance.

---

## Future Improvements

- Support for Apple Pay and Google Pay.
- WebSocket-based real-time payment status updates.
- GraphQL API layer for flexible client queries.
